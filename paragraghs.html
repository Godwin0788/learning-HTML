  <blockquote cite="https://www.wfp.org/ending-hunger">Hunger is discomfort or pain caused by a lack of food. It is different from food insecurity, which means lack of regular access to safe and nutritious food for proper development and an active and healthy life. Across the globe, as many as 343 million people are facing acute levels of food insecurity in the 74 countries with WFP operations and where data is available. The World Food Programme (WFP) works each day to tackle hunger, with the ultimate goal of a world where no one is left without enough food.</blockquote>
  <p>Wfp's goal is to: <q> We span a broad range of activities, bringing life-saving assistance in emergencies and supporting sustainable and resilient livelihoods </q></p>
